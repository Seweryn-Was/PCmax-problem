Problem definition can be found on wikipedia: 
- [PL](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optymalne_szeregowanie_zadań_dla_wielu_procesorów)
- [ENG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform-machines_scheduling)

## Purpose of this repository 
In this repository we will be creating our solution to the problem presented above. The assignment is done for studies for the subject of Combinatorial Optimization

Program is written in C++. Data will be inputed by .txt files which will follow the given format: 
```
7
5 5 7 7 4 4 3
2
```
- number of processes <br>
n = 7 <br>
- processes time<br>
processes = [5, 5, 7, 7, 4, 4, 3] <br> 
- number of processors<br>
m = 2<br>
